IBM Skillbuild - Employee Salary Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts whether an employee earns more than $50K annually based on demographic and work-related features.

Project Overview
This project uses the Adult Census Income dataset to build a classification model that predicts salary ranges. The application includes:

Data Analysis & Preprocessing: Jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis
Machine Learning Models: Comparison of multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Web Application: Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions
Features
ðŸ“Š Interactive Web Interface: User-friendly Streamlit application
ðŸ¤– Multiple ML Models: Trained and compared various algorithms
ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization: Comprehensive exploratory data analysis
ðŸ”„ Batch Predictions: Upload CSV files for bulk predictions
ðŸ“± Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices
